# Inventorymanager_bot

A telegram bot meant to take care of your inventory, automated and also deal with tasks and deadlines.
Payment wasn't part of the plan for this bot, but with use and request it could be added.
Bot will use sqlite3 for database and will be hosted on heroku.

I hope this solves someone's problem.
